After the game, Aces head coach Becky Hammon, who was the subject of several of the complaints Hamby alleged in the lawsuit, addressed the situation. As she did last season after the original league investigation in 2023 — when Hammon was suspended two games for violating workplace policies — Hammon insisted that her behavior was above board.
